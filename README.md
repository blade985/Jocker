Java on Docker Wrapper

We are trying to design the wrapper but to do this we need:

- A bare metal server
- - An Hypervisor [like KVM]
- - - A way to better manage the clustering of hypervisor [like Ganeti]
- - - - obviously: the virtual machine
- - - - Docker
- - - - - java inside Docker
- - - - - - WHAT THA FUCK ?!?!?!
